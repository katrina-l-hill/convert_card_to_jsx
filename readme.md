# Converting HTML Profile Card to JSX

# Author: Katrina Hill

# Report
This Converting HTML Profile Card to JSX application is structured using a parent-child component relationship. The `App` component serves as the main entry point, while the `UserProfile` component encapsulates the functionality and display logic for rendering user information. This modular design promotes reusability and separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and scale the application.

Challenges faced included utilizing props for data handling. In this case, the `UserProfile` component receives user information through props.
